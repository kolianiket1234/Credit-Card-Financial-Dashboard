# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard

### Introduction:
The Credit Card Financial Dashboard project is a data visualization and analysis tool designed to help users understand and monitor key financial metrics related to credit card usage. Using a structured dataset containing information about credit card transactions, customer demographics, and financial behavior, this dashboard provides insightful visualizations that support better financial decision-making.

This project leverages tools such as Power BI / Tableau / Python (Streamlit/Plotly) (depending on the implementation) to transform raw financial data into an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

### Key Features:
- Customer Segmentation based on financial behavior (e.g., spending patterns, balance usage).

- KPI Tracking, including metrics like total purchases, monthly payments, credit utilization, and default rates.

- Time-Series Analysis to observe changes in financial metrics over time.

- Visual Charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to simplify complex data.

- Filters and Drill-Downs for dynamic data exploration (e.g., by customer age, income group, or credit limit).

### Goals:
- Provide a clear and concise view of customer credit card performance.

- Identify potential risk areas, such as high default probabilities or maxed-out credit usage.

- Support strategic business decisions through data insights.

### Technologies Used:
- Python / Power BI / Tableau for dashboard development

- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn / Plotly for data manipulation and visualization

- Excel / CSV datasets for input
